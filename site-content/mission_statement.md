Chicken Soup for the Disgruntled Developer
==========================================
happifying hackers on a tri-weekly basis
------------------------------------------
### TL;DR
So you're developing software and you're getting paid for it? Consider yourself very lucky, there are few better professions.
Unfortunately, we all tend to forget that from time to time. (Not that our industry would make forgetting especially hard.)
So we set out to ask our role models how they keep their passion. Join us and hear what they have to say.

### So, what is this thing?
Have you ever felt the joy of writing code slipping away in your daily business? Did you still feel the excitement you felt during your first coding gigs in the face of looming deadlines and highly political environments? Did you repeatedly sacrifice large parts of your private life to allegedly save projects? Did you spend more effort on fixing the blame than on honing your skills at times? Did you abandon TDD, CI and clean coding despite knowing better and hated yourself for that?

Don't kid me: We've all been there. (And tend to come back from time to time.)

The good news is that that's just [life](http://www.mostly-harmless.de/sounds/life.wav). While Dilbert may be right quite often, you probably don't want to be that kind of uber-cynic. The important part is how to find your way out of such situations quickly and avoid getting bitter. If you reflect regularily on your work, it's quality and how you feel doing it, you will develop an early warning system that helps you to stay out of that kind of trouble. 

You are not alone. Many have thought, taught and written about being a happy kick-ass developer. We talk to our role models, thought leaders, authors and speakers how they tackle this challenge. Whether you call yourself a developer, programmer, software engineer, consultant or architect, we think you can benefit from the answers.

The interviews are available as [Videos](http://http://www.youtube.com/user/0xcafebabe2) and [MP3 Files](http://localhost:3333).
