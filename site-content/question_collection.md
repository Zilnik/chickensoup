### Questions
* Have you ever been to a point where you doubted you picked the right profession? 
	* Obviously you got back on track. How did you do this?
	* Do you have any habits, do you follow any practices/rituals that help you through difficult times?
* How do you deal with impediments imposed upon your work by (seemingly?) unreasonable business decisions?
* Do you think it is useful to explain software development / engineering processes and constraints to non-technical team members or customers
* How'd you explain the need to keep your codebase clean and tested? Any favorite metaphors?
* How do deal with large, seemingly unresolveable challenges, especially if your environment is unable to understand the nature of the challenge?
* What was your most difficult project, in terms of motivation? What did you do to bring it to a successful end? (it _was_ successful, wasn't it?)

* Do you have any advice for managers of development teams?
* How'd you describe an ideal corporate environment for developers?
